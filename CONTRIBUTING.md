# Contributing Guidelines

## Feature Requests and Bug Reports

* Feature requests and bug reports should preferably be submitted as issues on the project's [issue tracker](https://github.com/Pasi4K5/mod-pad/issues).
Alternatively, you can contact me directly (contact details below).

* Before opening an issue, please check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Pasi4K5/mod-pad/issues) to see if your request or bug has already been reported.

## Pull Requests

* Please ask before making any major changes.
Your vison of the project might not align with mine,
and I would like to avoid rejecting high-effort pull requests for that reason.

* This project uses ESLint and Prettier.
Please run Prettier and check for ESLint errors and warnings before committing your changes.
